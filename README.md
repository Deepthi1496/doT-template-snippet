# Installation
In order to install an extension you need to launch the Command Pallete (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P) and type Extensions. There you have either the option to show the already installed snippets or install new ones. Search for EmberJS es6 and install it.

# Supported languages (file extensions)
- JavaScript (.js)
- Javascript(ES6) Snippets for dotJS
- Below is a list of all available javascript snippets and the triggers of each one. The â‡¥ means the TAB key. All the snippets are indented as per ESLint

# Why code snippets?
- A code snippet is like the boilerplate which can be used frequently. 
- The main advantage of code snippets is that they speed up the development work. 
- They are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns

# doT.js 
doT.js was built in order to find the quickest and most compact JavaScript templating function possible, with a focus on performance in V8 and Node.js. 
It performs admirably in both Node.js and browsers.
## Features
1. There are no dependencies, and the 120 loc custom delimiters are exceptionally fast.
2. Evaluation at runtime.
3. Conditionals are supported. 
4. Runtime interpolation and compile-time evaluation. 
5. Partials and conditonal support.
6. Provides encoding. 
7. Array iterators.
8. Streaming-friendly whitespace - strip or presserve.
9. It's up to you whether you want to use it without logic or with reasoning.

## Here is the list of default delimiters:
|Trigger |	Content|
|-------|----------|
|`{{ }}`|	for evaluation|
|`{{= }}`|	for interpolation|

|`{{# }}`	|for compile-time evaluation/includes and partials|
|`{{## #}}`	|for compile-time defines|
|`{{? }}`|	for conditionals|
|`{{~ }}`	|for array iteration|
